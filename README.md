<b>IronFarm</b>
<br>
Different from vanilla is that Villager need to switch between doing Villager stuff and being scared.<br>
When modify/redesign the farm you need to take these into consideration. you have to ensure the villager can switch between doing normal things and being scared. not too fast, though.<br>
Here is an iron farm design i know works.<br>
