UneasyVanilla is a semi-anarchy/survival minecraft server, started on the 10th of March 2020, designed to give players total freedom to play Minecraft just as the developers intended.

You want people who aren't cheating to play with or maybe even against. You hate those typical factions plugins with claiming land and tpa commands. You want as close to vanilla experience as possible while also having zero rules in the game world itself? UneasyVanilla is your server. We're not anarchy, rather more lawless than anything else. You can do whatever you want in-game as long as you follow a few simple rules. If you want the full range of survival game play in a setting where someone might just be waiting behind any nether portal to kill you, where you can build or say anything you possibly could ever want, where the only staff interaction is to ban cheaters and make sure the server is running well, then this is your spot.

## Mechanic Informations

**Farms/Mechanics | Mechanic that is different from vanilla.**

**IronFarm / Villager lobotomize**
Different from vanilla is that Villager need to switch between doing Villager stuff and being scared.

When modify/redesign the farm you need to take these into consideration. 

you have to ensure the villager can switch between doing normal things and being scared too fast.

Villager need 2 or more block movable area for villager to be able to move around/path find.

Make sure villager arent able to walk on bed.

Trading halls: We recommend that you have villager in a 1x1 to minimize the villager lag/load on the server
